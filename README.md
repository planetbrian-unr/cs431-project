# CS 431 Project R11
## Team members: Brian Wu, Matthew Gaskell

We will be using the data stored [here](http://netsg.cs.sfu.ca/youtubedata/) to implement a Youtube data analyzer with a Network Aggregation function, which efficiently reports the following statistics of the Youtube video network:
- Degree distribution (including in-degree and out-degree); average degree, maximum, and minimum degree
- Categorized statistics: frequency of videos partitioned by a search condition: categorization, size of videos, view count, etc.

To accomplish this project, Spark and Python will be used.
